# FORTRAN Programs - Computational Laboratory

This repository contains all FORTRAN programs that are taught in the **Computational and Numerical Methods (PHY 506 MJP)** course in MSc-I Physics at Savitribai Phule Pune University. The programs will be updated on a weekly basis.

## How to compile and run the program:

1. To compile the program, run the following command on your terminal:

```
gfortran -o output_filename program.f90
```

2. To run the program, run the following command on your terminal:

```
./output_filename
```

## How to run the BASH script:

1. Run the BASH script using:

```
./mkf90.sh
```

2. It will prompt you `Enter the program name:`. Enter the name you want your program to be named.

3. After that it will prompt you `Enter the path of the directory:`. Enter the name of the directory you want to save the file in. 

That's it.
