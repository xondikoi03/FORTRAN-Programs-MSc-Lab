# FORTRAN Programs - Computational Laboratory

This repository contains all FORTRAN programs that are taught in the *Computational and Numerical Methods (PHY 506 MJP)* course in MSc-I Physics at Savitribai Phule Pune University. The programs will be updated on a weekly basis.

## How to compile and run the program:

1. To compile the program, run the following command on your terminal:

```
gfortran -o output_filename program.f90
```

2. To run the program, run the following command on your terminal:

```
./output_filename
```

That's it.

> **Note :** I'll update at the end of the semester, if I pass this course (FR!)
